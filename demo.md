# LAPPS-CLARIN Integration Demo

## NLP Intro
* Make clear that WL users have a WL experience and LAPPS users get a LAPPS experience. So WL users will be able to go to LIF/LAPPS for some other processing, but would go back to TCF for visualization.
* intro to LAPPS
* **WebLicht** is an environment for building, executing, and visualizing the results of NLP pipelines, which is integrated into the CLARIN infrastructure. WebLicht NLP tools consume and produce the **Text Corpus Format (TCF)** data, an XML format designed for use as an inter- nal data exchange format for WebLicht processing tools.
* concepts: tokens, pos, NE, â€¦
* example(s) of aggregation

## Showcase
* Screencast to create and execute a simple tool chain including services from both LAPPS and CLARIN.
    * Webcasts should be short and snappy.
